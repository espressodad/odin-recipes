<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sourdough starter (unfed/discard)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup + 2 T to 3/4 cup water (lukewarm)</li>
        <li>2.5 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>.5 teaspoon instant yeast or active dry yeast</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir any liquid on top of your refrigerated starter back into it before measuring 1 cup into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In your large mixing bowl or bowl of your stand mixer, /
            combine the lesser amount of water, the flour, salt, yeast, and Pizza Dough Flavor with the sourdough starter.</li>
        <li>Mix to combine, adding the remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough looks dry. Knead for about 7 minutes using a stand mixer with its dough hook, /
        until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased container, cover, and let rise until almost doubled in bulk. Depending on the vitality of your starter, this will take between 2 and 4 hours. /
            For a faster rise, place the dough in a warm spot (or double the yeast).</li>
        <li>For a thicker, large pizza: Oil a 14" round pizza pan or 18" x 13" half-sheet pan. Place the dough in the pan and press it out to the edges, /
            again giving it a 15-minute rest before continuing if it starts to snap back.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan(s) and let the dough rise until it's as thick as you like.</li>
        <li>Toward the end of the rise, preheat your oven to 450Â°F.</li>
        <li>Sauce and top each pizza as you like, but don't add cheese yet (this ensures a crispy crust). Bake thin-crust pizzas for 5 minutes before removing from the oven and adding cheese. /
            For thick-crust pizza, bake for 10 minutes before removing from the oven and adding cheese. Return to the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes more, until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the over and enjoy hot.</li>
